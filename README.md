# -Kenya 5th President-Sentimental-Analysis-Phython-

Introduction

Kenya had a fierce 2022 election between two Kingpins, Hon. Raila Omolo Odinga and Dr. William Samoei Ruto. Each shared an almost equal number of following. I decided to conduct a sentimental analysis to confirm if, as a country, we have reached the level where we can congratulate the winner of a presidential election, especially those who did not vote for the candidate or the opposing camp, analyzing a sample of reactions on  Twitter.

Findings

As expected, the side that supported the winning candidate, Ruto, tweeted with all sorts of congratulatory messages. However, the other camp did not congratulate the winner. The chart shows that they were either neutral or did not see the need to tweet.

Conclusion

Kenya may have a serious challenge accepting the outcome of the Presidential elections. Accepting defeat and congratulating the winner is a culture the future generation should start embracing. All is not lost because the trend of accepting defeat and acknowledging the winner can be seen in other lower seats, including the gubernatorial, senate, and member of parliament.
